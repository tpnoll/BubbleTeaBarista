My first attempt at a cross-platform browser videogame

This is a simple game I created to be played onstage by an actress in Cypress Production's performance of The Amphibians by Dan Caffrey.

Open index.html in your preferred browser to play the game.

Gently drag the spoon with your mouse or finger to scoop tapioca pearls into the cup as they fall into the water.
